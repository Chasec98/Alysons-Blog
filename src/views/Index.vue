              Hi, Yâ€™all! Aly here, a complete goofball from Toledo, Ohio, who
              moved away and fell in love with the gorgeous state of Michigan. I
              attend school in Grand Rapids and live a life full of crazy
              adventures, delicious plant-based food, and seizing every moment.
              I study the science of politics (aka, Political Science) and
              Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Grand Valley State
              University. With all my extra time, I also find myself minoring in
              the snooze fest that is the Stock Market - I mean Economics
              (actually, I find such pretty interesting). Daily, you will see me
              enjoying my position on the Executive Council of my sorority,
              being a passionate pre-law student, and probably spending way too
              much time at the gym. Most importantly, after 18 years of wishing
              I was always somewhere I was not, and two years creating my world
              to be the one I had always dreamed of, I happily report I am
              finally at a point in my life where I want to help others live
              this rewarding and unbelievable lifestyle. I am a traveler, proud
              owner of a gorgeous set of skis, a white water kayaker, an
              adrenaline fanatic, and possess a fabulous eye for finding vegan
              food wherever I go (I am looking at you, Tennessee). To see all of
              my adventure, travel, and yummy plant-based eating advice, look no
              further than this blog. Also, follow me on instagram to be updated
              every time I upload a new blog post! This is real, this is me: a
              woman who was sick of waiting for life to happen, and decided to
              go out there and make my dreams my reality.
